"""
Regression tests for wrapper.py exception-hygiene fixes (Phase 2 of the
perf/best-practices remediation, docs/perf_bestpractices_audit_2026-07-10.md).

Covers two independent fixes:

1. `_is_oom_error` — a shared OOM-detection helper that recognizes both the
   typed `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` and the string-matching heuristic used
   by third-party code (e.g. TensorRT) that surfaces OOM as a generic
   RuntimeError. Pure function, CPU-only.

2. `_load_model`'s SDXL pipeline-type-mismatch handling — previously, when an
   SDXL model was detected but loaded with the wrong pipeline type and the
   explicit `StableDiffusionXLPipeline` retry also failed, the code silently
   logged a warning and continued with the mismatched pipeline. The fix
   raises RuntimeError on retry failure instead, refusing to proceed with a
   known-wrong pipeline type. That raise is caught by the enclosing
   `for method in loading_methods` loop's own except/continue, so it falls
   through to the next loading method rather than crashing outright — this
   test drives all three loading methods to fail and asserts the final error
   carries evidence that the fail-fast fired (rather than the old silent
   continuation).

Both tests are deliberately CPU-only and model-free (no real diffusers model
is loaded), following the object.__new__ shell pattern used elsewhere in
tests/unit/ (see test_safety_checker.py, test_normal_bae_fallback.py).

        Path contains 'sdxl' + .safetensors -> loading_methods tries
        StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_single_file first. Its first call
        succeeds but returns a non-SDXL-typed pipe, triggering the mismatch
        branch; the retry (second call to the same mocked method) fails.
        The other two loading methods are also made to fail so _load_model
        exhausts all methods and raises its final RuntimeError.

        Two things must hold:
        - the mismatch branch's failure is logged as a "pipeline retry ...
          also failed" warning (proving the fail-fast fired instead of the
          old silent "continue with the originally loaded pipeline"), and
        - _load_model does not crash trying to use the discarded
          wrong-typed pipe as if it were a valid load (regression guard for
          the stale `pipe` reference the fail-fast must clear).
